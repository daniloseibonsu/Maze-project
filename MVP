USER STORY

End users want to be able to play a maze game using SDL2, so that they can have fun solving the maze and challenging myself to improve my speed and accuracy.

When they start the game, they want to see a main menu that allows them to start a new game, load a saved game, or quit the game. If they choose to start a new game, they want to be able to select the difficulty level of the maze, including the size of the maze and the number of obstacles.

Once the game starts, they want to see a maze on the screen, with a character that they control using the arrow keys on their keyboard. They want the character to move smoothly and quickly, without any lag or delay. They also want to see a timer that counts down the time they have to complete the maze, as well as a score that reflects their progress through the maze.

As they navigate through the maze, they want to be able to collect coins or other rewards that will increase their score. They also want to encounter obstacles that will slow them down or make it harder to reach the end of the maze.

When they reach the end of the maze, they want to see a message that congratulates them on completing the maze, and that displays their final score and the time it took them to complete the maze. They also want the option to save their game, so that they can come back and play again later.

Throughout the game, they want to hear sound effects that correspond to their actions, such as collecting coins or hitting an obstacle. They also want to hear music that adds to the excitement and challenge of the game.

Finally, they want the game to be visually appealing, with high-quality graphics and animations that make it fun to play and keep them engaged throughout the game.
